# Model, training, Inference, Token, Parameter, GPU/CPU

Understanding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can seem daunting for beginners, but breaking down the core concepts makes it accessible. This comprehensive guide explains six fundamental concepts that form the backbone of modern AI systems: models, training, inference, tokens, parameters, and the role of GPU/CPU hardware. Each concept builds upon the others to create intelligent systems that can understand language, recognize images, and make predictions. Whether you’re a student, professional, or simply curious about AI, mastering these fundamentals will provide you with the foundation to understand how AI systems work and why they’ve become so powerful in recent years.
